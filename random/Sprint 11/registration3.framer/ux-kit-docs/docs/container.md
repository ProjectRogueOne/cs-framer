# Container

A container is a box with different colors and borders. It provides the base element for Button and TextField components.

## Fill

Buttons may have any [valid color](colors.md) as its fill.

```coffeescript
primaryButton = new cs.Button
	fill: 'primary'

warnButton = new cs.Button
	fill: 'primary'
```

By default, a button's fill is `'primary'`.

## Border

Buttons may have any [valid color](colors.md) as its border.

```coffeescript
primaryButton = new cs.Button
	fill: 'primary'

warnButton = new cs.Button
	fill: 'primary'
```

By default, a button has no border.
