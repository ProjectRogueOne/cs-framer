# WitchHunt (working title, "The Cops")

WitchHunt is an online community for solving real-world mysteries. 

On the WitchHunt app, users can join amateur investigations, examine the evidence, take part in the discussion and generate new evidence by following real-world leads. Mysteries might be global and far-reaching, such as unmasking terrorists or revealing international conspiracies - or as local as finding the criminals behind a vandalized monument.

As a new source of international justice, WitchHunt's community provides media outlets, NGOs, police and federal agencies with a constant stream of tips, leads and evidence.

# Less Nice Version

WitchHunt is a theoretical product that courts disaster by serving a community that shouldn't exist: internet detectives, whose amateur investigations are themselves a huge threat to justice and the rule of law. 

Unfortunately, people do participate in online witch hunts, and they do so with high levels of engagement. They are users with particular needs and interests, and any product that sought to cater to them would encounter several unqiue challenges. As a designer, Witch Hunt is my answer to an interesting question that no one should ask: how can I improve the experience of internet detectives, get rid of the bugs that lead to crime and abuse, and create communities that actually produce something worthwhile? 

Or, failing that, how can I disrupt public-sector justice? 

Many digital products represent the worst in late capitalism by undermining the public sector and competing with governments on areas properly served by government. One of the primary purposes of a government - arguably the minimum service any government must provide - is the to monopolize force and determine justice for its citizens. Vigilantism is toxic to society - but for fun, let's try it anyway.
